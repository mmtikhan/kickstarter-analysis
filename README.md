# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The project is created in order to compare Louiseâ€™s play Fever, which came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time, with other similar projects.

### Purpose
To chow the relations between launch date and goal amount and how its affect the project success.

## Analysis and Challenges
During the project analysis a data, similar to play Fever, from kickstarter projects were collected, investigated and organized in some report which allows to visualize and understand the kickstarter tendencies.

Outcomes Based on Lunch Date report shows how the project start date affect the its success. This report allows to see the best and the worst months to start a project and analyze when was the time the most projects succeeds or failed.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Outcomes Based on Outcomes Based on Goals show how the money goals affect the success of the project. We can analyze and find the best money range to ack for a successful project.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
During building the report we can notice some projects that break the pattern and bring attention for example in Outcomes Based on Outcomes Based on Goals we can se that the more money is asked for the project the less projects succeed, however om range 35000-45000 we can see that the amount of successful project is exceed the unsuccessful it raises a question if it's worth to star a high budget project.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
According to Outcomes based on Launch Date we can conclude that the most companies succeed during the summer time and the best month to start a project is May. The winter time is the worst time to start a campaign and the worst month is December.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
According to Outcomes based on Goals we can see that the less money is asked for campaign the more chances that the project will succeed the best range is 0-4999 with 75% success and second best is 5000-25000 with 50% success in addition the amount is higher that $25000 is not recommended because the success drops to 25%

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
We definitely don't have enough data for high budget projects and while some options can be misunderstood as a good plan we don't recommend to consider them because of small amount of projects for analysis.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
For the future projects and report we can analysis what percent of goal amount was reached and how far from success were failed projects. How deadline affect the success and what is better short or long term campaign and dependence of campaign's time to its goal amount. Analysis the average donations in compare to project characteristics.
